- [94mcookiecutter-new-project.sh[0m: create new data-science project using cookiecutter

There were many useful scientific and machine learning packages preinstalled
You can verify which packages are available by running: [36m$ conda list[0m

Three environments iwere installed: [34mbase[0m, [34mtensorflow[0m and [34mtorch[0m
You can change active environment using: [36m$ conda activate env_name[0m

Default conda environment is set by [36mCONDA_DEFAULT_ENV[0m environment variable
You can change it in the docker-compose [94m.yml[0m file or [94m~/.profile[0m

You can also find out about installed packages by inspecting manifest files:
[94m/environment_base.yml[0m, [94m/environment_tensorflow.yml[0m and [94m/environment_torch.yml[0m

Miniforge3 environment (conda) was installed in [94m/opt/conda[0m 
With [94mnb_conda_kernels[0m extension, whenever you create a new environment
it will be available to you as a kernel in the jupyterlab environment
To help recognise new environment as kernel, install [94mipykernel[0m conda package

To execute commands as root use: [36msudo[0m, password is: [36mpassword[0m unless changed
