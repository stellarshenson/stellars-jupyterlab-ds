## Key Features
- **JupyterLab Extensions:**
  - JupyterLab-Git extension
  - JupyterLab-LSP (Python) for enhanced autocompletion and code suggestions with documentation
  - Resource usage monitor

- **TensorBoard:**
  - TensorBoard server running on port `6006`, with logs stored in `/tmp/tf_logs` to monitor your ML/AI model training and neural network development

## Installation

To use this environment, Docker must be installed on your system. JupyterLab 4 is provided as a Docker container, ensuring complete isolation from your system's software.

**Docker Hub Repository:** [Stellars JupyterLab DS](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/stellars/stellars-jupyterlab-ds/general)

### Required Software
1. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - Includes the `docker-compose` command necessary to run the container.
2. `docker-compose` - Installed automatically with Docker Desktop.

### Usage

1. **Pull the latest container image:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose pull
   ```

2. *(Optional)* **Build the image locally:**  
   Note that building the image locally may take approximately 1.5 hours.
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Start the container with your desired configuration:**
   - Standard non-CUDA container:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```
   - Standard CUDA container:
     ```bash
     docker-compose -f docker-compose-nvidia.yml up
     ```
   - Custom container configuration:
     ```bash
     docker-compose -f local/your-custom-docker-compose.yml up
     ```
   - Alternatively, use the provided `bin/start*` scripts.

4. **Access JupyterLab:**  
   Open [https://localhost:8888](https://localhost:8888) in your browser.

5. **Access TensorBoard:**  
   Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) in your browser.

**Quick Configuration Tips:**
- Use the `CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV` variable in the `docker-compose.yml` files to specify your default conda environment.

## Default Settings
- **Work Directory:** `~/workspace`
- **Home Directory:** `/home/lab` (contains user settings)
- **JupyterLab Settings:** Stored in `/home/lab/.jupyter`
- **Volume Mapping:** If using `docker-compose`, local `/home` and `~/workspace` directories are mapped to persistent docker volumes respectivey. Thanks to this you can frequently update **stellars-jupyterlab-ds** container image without affecting your work
- **Root Access:** You have access to the local root account with `sudo` (password: `password`).
- **TensorBoard Logs Directory:** `/tmp/tf_logs`
- **Ports:**
  - TensorBoard: `6006`
  - JupyterLab: `8888`
- **Conda Environments:** 
  - `base` - basic machine learning tools and packages
  - `tensorflow` - environment with all tools from `base` and latest stable `tensorflow` installed with NVIDIA GPU support
  - `torch` - environment with all tools from `base` and latest stable `torch` installed with NVIDIA GPU support. Additionally packages from `ultralytics` were installed for your __YOLO__ projects

**Tip:** You can change envionment using `conda activate env_name` command. You can also set default environment either by setting `CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV` in `docker-compose.yml` file or in the `~/.profile` file in your home directory

**Tip:** You don't need to run `docker-compose build` if you pull the image from Docker Hub. Running `docker-compose up` for the first time will automatically use the pre-built package if available.

## Configuration Details

- **./build:** Contains container build artifacts. Typically, you won't need to interact with this directory.
- **./.env:** Contains the project name, used for naming volumes and the Docker Compose project.

**Tip:** Modify the `/opt/workspace` entry in the `volumes:` section of the `docker-compose` files to map to a different project location on your filesystem.
