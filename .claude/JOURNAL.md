# Project Journal

1. **Task - On-demand environment installation**: Migrated from pre-installed conda environments to declarative on-demand installation via workspace utilities<br>
    **Result**: Major architectural change to reduce Docker image size and build time by moving conda environment installations from build-time to runtime. Commented out tensorflow, torch, and r_base environment installations in Dockerfile (lines 369-400, 449-452). Created workspace-utils install-conda-env.sh menu system with dedicated installation scripts in install-conda-env.d/ directory: tensorflow.sh (clones base + installs from /environment_tensorflow.yml), torch.sh (clones base + installs from /environment_torch.yml), r.sh (creates fresh + installs from /environment_r.yml), rust.sh (creates fresh with evcxr Jupyter kernel from /environment_rust.yml). Modified test-cuda.sh to check environment existence via conda env list before executing tests, providing user-friendly installation instructions if environments not found. Updated Dockerfile to copy environment_rust.yml to container root. Updated welcome-template.html to reflect "Pre-installed: base" and "Install on-demand: tensorflow, torch, r_base, rust" with workspace-utils installation instructions. Updated welcome-message.txt to mention "ai assistants and extra environments". Added version comment to environment_base_jupyterlab.yml. Created comprehensive RELEASE.md entry for version 2.60 documenting breaking changes, migration guide, benefits, and technical details. All changes staged in git, ready for commit
